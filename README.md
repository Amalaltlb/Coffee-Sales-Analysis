## Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
    - **XLOOKUP** and **INDEX MATCH** functions for data retrieval and referencing.
    - Multiple **IF** functions for conditional logic.
    - Date and number formatting for consistency.
    - Checking for duplicates and removing redundant data.
    - Converting ranges to tables for better data management.
  - **Data Analysis and Visualization**
