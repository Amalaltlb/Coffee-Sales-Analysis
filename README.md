# Coffee Sales Data Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves analyzing coffee sales data to identify trends, top customers, and sales by country performance. The goal is to develop an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel, providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making. The analysis focuses on sales patterns, key customer segments, and country-specific sales performance, enabling users to make informed decisions based on the data.

## Key Features

### 1. Sales Trend Analysis
- Analyzed overall coffee sales trends over time, including monthly and seasonal variations.
- Visualized sales performance by product, region, and customer segment.
- **Insights**: Helps identify patterns in sales, peak periods, and potential areas for product stocking or promotional activities.

### 2. Top Customer Identification
- Identified top 5 customers based on total sales and purchasing behaviors using PivotTables.
- Displayed the top customers in order from highest to lowest sales with a **bar chart**.
- **Insights from the Top 5 Customer Bar Chart**:
  - **Customer Value**: Identifies the customers contributing most to revenue.
  - **Customer Loyalty**: Highlights top customers who may be loyal, especially those using loyalty cards.
  - **Targeted Marketing**: Enables targeted campaigns for retaining and acquiring similar customers.
  - **Sales Growth Opportunity**: Recognizes opportunities to grow sales by acquiring more customers like your top ones.
  - **Purchasing Preferences**: Helps determine popular product choices (e.g., roast types or coffee sizes) among top customers.

### 3. Sales by Country
- Compared sales performance across different countries.
- Created **visualizations** to identify top 3 high-performing countries.
- **Insights**: Enables business leaders to focus on countries with high sales performance, and make data-driven decisions to enhance sales strategies in other regions by identifying areas with potential for growth.

### 4. Interactive Dashboard
- Built an interactive dashboard using PivotTables and PivotCharts.
- Used **Timelines** and **Slicers** for users to filter and interact with the data, enabling dynamic exploration of key metrics.
- Users can filter by:
  - **Time Period** (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly)
  - **Product Type** (e.g., coffee size, roast type)
  - **Customer Segments** (e.g., top customers and loyalty card users)

## Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **XLOOKUP** and **INDEX MATCH**: For data retrieval and referencing.
- **IF functions**: Applied for conditional logic and categorization.
- **PivotTables and PivotCharts**: For summarizing and visualizing the data.
- **Timelines and Slicers**: For creating an interactive, user-friendly experience.

## Dataset
- **Raw Data**: `coffeeOrders_RawData.xlsx` – Original unprocessed data.
- **Processed Data**: `coffeeOrdersProject_Dashboard.xlsx` – Cleaned and structured data used to build the dynamic dashboard.

## Users
The dashboard can be used by the following groups:

- **Sales Managers**
  - Monitor sales trends and customer behavior, optimize sales strategies, and track the performance of regional sales.
  
- **Marketing Teams**
  - Identify top customer segments, plan targeted marketing campaigns, and measure campaign performance based on sales data.

## Impact
The interactive dashboard enables users to interact with and explore coffee sales data in real time, providing insights that can help drive decisions on inventory management, marketing, and sales strategies. It allows businesses to better understand sales patterns, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer targeting.

## How to Use
